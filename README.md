# Rendering Dice with Pixar's Renderman
![D20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb2c353-3dec-43fe-8bf5-039ab5328b7e)


This is my Renderman project, comprised of a mix of RIB and Python files, that somewhat modularly create a RIB scene, populated with dice. 
Has the baseline functionality to render a close-up of D20, as well as a shot with D20 multiples.

I am currently working on generating the rest of the dice set, so not only the shaders but the dice themselves can be swapped on the go.

## If you want to play around:
1. Clone
2. Run from /source
3. prman *chose the rib file*
4. To compile shaders: oslc ../shaders/osl/myshader.osl -o ../shaders/oso/myshader.oso 

## D20
D20 is a Subdivision Mesh, generated by a respective .py file. It is based on plotting the points of the [isocahedron with the Fibonnaci sequence](https://frfly.wordpress.com/2016/02/28/dodecahedron/), and then connecting them in the correct order (which I totally ripped off the internet) to make an enclosed shape. 
Each face made this way is supplied with a FaceID (which this time I determined myself with the help of a paper D20), and each edge is creased to create the bevel. I would also like to make the crease amount adjustable, since some dice are sharp-edged and some are smoother than other.
The FaceID helps with the number displacement, by placing a correct number at the correct face, because, as a rule of thumb, most D20 have opposite faces give 21 as their sum, which makes chance distribution fair.

## Numbers
Numbers are custom displacement maps, which are cycled through as a loop and then pulled to map onto a correct face, according to the Face ID. This does make the textures bigger, but also allows swapping the numbers one by one, for example, to have a custom symbol instead of 1 or 20, but doesnt require changing of the whole set.
Or use of any DCC tools for that matter

## Shaders
Each die has a master shader that mixes the die material shader and the number material shader.
Die shader and number shader are created from patterns that use compiled .osl shaders for materials.
Again, this allows to have a library of materials and swap them as desired

## Further work
1. Get controls for the creases on D20
2. Generate the rest of the dice set as Subdiv Meshes
3. Play with more complex shaders
